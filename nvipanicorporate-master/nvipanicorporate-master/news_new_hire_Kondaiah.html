            <p>Bengaluru, June 27, 2018: Bengaluru-based startup nVipani brings valUchain™, its cloud-based, blockchain and IoT-enabled smart supply chain management (SCM) solution to RISE 2018.A truly global SCM, valUchain™ combines logistics, inventory, warehouse, and order management in an affordable, easy-to-use solution for agricultural and food processing, FMCG, manufacturing, pharma, and other industrial and business sectors.
            </p>
            <p>Integrating a B2B marketplace and a universal product catalogue in standard (HSN/SAC) formats, valUchain™ simplifies product recalls and provides end-to-end, forward and backward traceability. Besides offering all standard SCM features and services, valUchain™ is specifically designed to provide comprehensive protection against counterfeiting, pilferage, and supply chain fraud.</p>
            <p>“I want to make smart SCM ubiquitous, affordable, and easy to use,” says  Dilli Babu Nandarapu, the CEO and founder of nVipani. His vision is to connect the most remote, rural production units to the global market.  “The global counterfeiting market robs legitimate industry of 1.2 trillion USD in 2018. This figure is poised to reach 1.82 trillion USD by 2020,” he said, adding, “Our valUchain™ can prevent counterfeiting with end-to-end traceability in the supply chain. By accounting for every unit via blockchain, we enable all stakeholders in the supply chain to ensure the authenticity and provenance of all products they sell or buy.”</p>
            <p>Mane Kuragayalu Project (MKP), the Telangana government initiative to bring farm-fresh vegetables and fruit to every urban home will be powered by valUchain™. Initiated as a pilot program by Telangana state government, MKP will link farmers and their fresh produce to the market via a short supply chain.</p>
            <p>Hema Reddy, the CTO and co-founder of nVipani points out that valUchain™ is easy to customize and localize. “Our unique architecture and supply chain model makes it easy to customize valUchain™ to manage any type of product or service. Employing GS1 and other international business standards, it is ready for international trade.”</p>
